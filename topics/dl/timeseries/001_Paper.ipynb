    "**What is multi-horizon forecasting(MHF)?**  \n",
    "Multi-horizon forecasting(MHF) often contains a `complex mix of inputs` - including `static covariates`, known `future inputs` and other `exogenous time series` that are only observed in the past - without any prior information on how they interact witht the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is new in this paper?**  \n",
    "There are many DL architectures published for multi-horizon forecasting problems but most of them are `black box` models. This paper brings insights into how the full range of inputs present in practical scenarios\n",

    "A TFT is a novel attention based architecture which combines high performance multi-horizon forecasting with interpretable insights into temporal dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is powers the TFT architecture?**    \n",
    "To learn temporal relationship at different scales, TFT uses `Recurrent Neural Network(RNN)` for local processing and interpretable self-attention layers for long-term dependencies.\n",
    "It utilizes specialized components to select relevant features and a series of gating layers to suppress unnecessary components, enabling high performance in a wide range of scenarios.\n",
