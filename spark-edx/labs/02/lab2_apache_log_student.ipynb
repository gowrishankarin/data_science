    "# **Web Server Log Analysis with Apache Spark**\n",
    " \n",
    "####This lab will demonstrate how easy it is to perform web server log analysis with Apache Spark.\n",
    " \n",
    "####Server log analysis is an ideal use case for Spark.  It's a very large, common data source and contains a rich set of information.  Spark allows you to store your logs in files on disk cheaply, while still providing a quick and simple way to perform data analysis on them.  This homework will show you how to use Apache Spark on real-world text-based production logs and fully harness the power of that data.  Log data comes from many sources, such as web, file, and compute servers, application logs, user-generated content,  and can be used for monitoring servers, improving business and customer intelligence, building recommendation systems, fraud detection, and much more."

This means using the various [RDD](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.html#pyspark.RDD) operations along with [`lambda` functions](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/controlflow.html#lambda-expressions) that are applied at each worker.\n",

    "####Using the CLF as defined above, we create a regular expression pattern to extract the nine fields of the log line using the Python regular expression [`search` function](https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html#regular-expression-objects).

A '-' value in the content size field is cleaned up by substituting it with 0. The function converts the log line's date string into a Python `datetime` object using the given `parse_apache_time` function."

    "####We can compute the statistics by applying a `map` to the `access_logs` RDD. The `lambda` function we want for the map is to extract the `content_size` field from the RDD. The map produces a new RDD containing only the `content_sizes` (one element for each Row object in the `access_logs` RDD). To compute the minimum and maximum statistics, we can use [`min()`](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.html#pyspark.RDD.min) and [`max()`](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.html#pyspark.RDD.max) functions on the new RDD. We can compute the average statistic by using the [`reduce`](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.html#pyspark.RDD.reduce) function with a `lambda` function that sums the two inputs, which represent two elements from the new RDD that are being reduced together. The result of the `reduce()` is the total content size from the log and it is to be divided by the number of requests as determined using the [`count()`](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.html#pyspark.RDD.count) function on the new RDD."

    "####Next, lets look at the response codes that appear in the log. As with the content size analysis, first we create a new RDD by using a `lambda` function to extract the `response_code` field from the `access_logs` RDD. The difference here is that we will use a [pair tuple](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/datastructures.html?highlight=tuple#tuples-and-sequences) instead of just the field itself. Using a pair tuple consisting of the response code and 1 will let us count how many records have a particular response code. Using the new RDD, we perform a [`reduceByKey`](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.html#pyspark.RDD.reduceByKey) function. `reduceByKey` performs a reduce on a per-key basis by applying the `lambda` function to each element, pairwise with the same key. We use the simple `lambda` function of adding the two values. Then, we cache the resulting RDD and create a list by using the [`take`](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.html#pyspark.RDD.take) function."

First we need to extract the labels and fractions for the graph. We do this with two separate `map` functions with a `lambda` functions. The first `map` function extracts a list of of the response code values, and the second `map` function extracts a list of the per response code counts  divided by the total size of the access logs. Next, we create a figure with `figure()` constructor and use the `pie()` method to create the pie plot."

    "#### **(2d) Example: Frequent Hosts**\n",
    "####Let's look at hosts that have accessed the server multiple times (e.g., more than ten times). As with the response code analysis in (2b), first we create a new RDD by using a `lambda` function to extract the `host` field from the `access_logs` RDD using a pair tuple consisting of the host and 1 which will let us count how many records were created by a particular host's request. Using the new RDD, we perform a `reduceByKey` function with a `lambda` function that adds the two values. We then filter the result based on the count of accesses by each host (the second element of each pair) being greater than ten. Next, we extract the host name by performing a `map` with a `lambda` function that returns the first element of each pair. Finally, we extract 20 elements from the resulting RDD - *note that the choice of which elements are returned is not guaranteed to be deterministic.*"

Next, we create a figure with `figure()` constructor, set various features of the plot (axis limits, grid lines, and labels), and use the `plot()` method to create the line plot."

    "#### **(2f) Example: Top Endpoints**\n",
    "####For the final example, we'll look at the top endpoints (URIs) in the log. To determine them, we first create a new RDD by using a `lambda` function to extract the `endpoint` field from the `access_logs` RDD using a pair tuple consisting of the endpoint and 1 which will let us count how many records were created by a particular host's request. Using the new RDD, we perform a `reduceByKey` function with a `lambda` function that adds the two values. We then extract the top ten endpoints by performing a [`takeOrdered`](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.html#pyspark.RDD.takeOrdered) with a value of 10 and a `lambda` function that multiplies the count (the second element of each pair) by -1 to create a sorted list with the top endpoints at the bottom."
