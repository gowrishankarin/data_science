### Introduction
United States' Environmental Protection Agency(EPA) is tasked with setting antional ambient air quality standards for the fin PM and for tracking the emissions of this pollutant into the atmosphere. Approximatly every 3 years, the EPA releases its database on emissions of PM2.5. This database is known as the National Emissions Inventory (NEI). You can read more information about the NEI at the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/eiinformation.html">EPA National Emissions Inventory web site.</a>

This analysis focus on the data acquired for the years 1999, 2002, 2005 and 2008

### Data Source
####Source Classification Code - SCC

This table provides a mapping from the SCC digit strings in the Emissions table to the actual name of the PM2.5 source.

####National Emission Inventory - NEI
This table contains a data frame with all of the PM2.5 emissions data for 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008. For each year, the table contains number of tons of PM2.5 emitted from a specific type of source for the entire year. Here are the first few rows.
